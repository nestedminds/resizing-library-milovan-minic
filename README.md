Resizing library

This task is created for apprentices who want to learn about OOP

Create PHP library which will resize the images.

For cropping images we will use library "image-workshop" - https://packagist.org/packages/sybio/image-workshop

Library need to support several types of resizing

Exact: Resize to exact width and height. Aspect ratio will not be maintained
Auto: The best strategy (portrait or landscape) will be selected for a given image according to its aspect ratio
Crop: This option will crop your images to the exact size you specify with no distortion
Square: This strategy will first crop the image by its shorter dimension to make it a square, then resize it to the specified size
In this first part of the task is widely open to any kind of implementation.
